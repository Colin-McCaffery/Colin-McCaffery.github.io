        <li>This is the url to our github repo <a href="https://github.com/343s24/final-project-team10">https://github.com/343s24/final-project-team10</a></li>
        <li>The site is published at <a href="http://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/merkelzd/cs343/dnd/index.html">http://w3stu.cs.jmu.edu/merkelzd/cs343/dnd/index.html</a></li>
        <li>You are currently looking at the report!</li>
        <li>In the itemStyle, monsterStyle, and spellStyle files there are media queries to make the info display below the table when under a certain screen size</li>
        <li>We have the home page, the dice rolling page, the items page, the spells page, and the monsters page.</li>
        <li>There is a consistent dnd tools banner on every page</li>
        <li>We do not currently have proper navigation set up but we plan to add it in the future along with making it responsive so it turns into a dropdown on mobile.</li>
        <li>There are images on the dice rolling page for the dice which all have proper alt text</li>
        <li>The site properly validates on both the nu and WAVE validator for every page</li>
        <li>There is a form on the character creator page</li>
        <li>There is a link to an external site on the home page but more will be added when the apis are implemented to link to more information about the spells/monsters/items</li>
        <li>There will be network requests implemented on the items, spells, and monster pages to fetch the info, there is already an api on the spells page but it is very slow and not well implemented</li>
